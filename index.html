		<p>In 2020 we decided to do our first family trip and flew to the coast of Goa in southern India to a village called Palolim.
		 It was me, my wife and our two children - Nave who was 3 years old and Sahar who was 1 year old.</p><br>
			
        <p>During the trip we spent a lot of time at the beaches of Palulem, and the nearby beaches of Patnam and Agonda.
		   In this stretch of beaches, a calm and relaxing shanty atmosphere is maintained.
		   We did a lot of hiking in the wild, went boating on the lakes, walked the markets and ate at local restaurants.
		   The children's experience was amazing and they greatly enjoyed the exposure to new worlds and landscapes,
		   to people who look different from them and speak a language different from their own,
		   to different foods and flavors.</p> <br>
		
		<p>We as a couple of parents also had a very good experience. We realized how much we enjoy being together,
		   how important it is for us to spend quality time with the children and how important and fulfilling this kind of experience is.
		   It was an unforgettable experience that we will definitely do again.</p> <br>
		
		<p> People say you either fall in love with her or you hate her
	      People say that you either love India very much or you hate her very much. We were undoubtedly one of those who fell in love,
		  so during the years 2011-2020 we visited India five times.
		  On each visit we were in different places and districts and discovered new wonders and pleasures.
		  We started our travels in India as a young couple traveling alone in many place,
		  we are happy that we manage to keep the tradition of traveling in India to do a trip with our children as well.</p> <br>

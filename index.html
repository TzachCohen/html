      <br />
      <p>India is an amazing, special and beautiful country, which covers a vast area and includes 28 countries.<br>
			My wife and I made our first visit to India in 2011 for a period of 4 months and the experience was unforgettable.
			While many people falling in love in India, there are others who haven't connected with the place or are reluctant to go there.</p>
			
        <p>Fortunately for us, we really enjoyed the trip there, and therefore during the years 2011-2020 we visited India five times.
		on each visit we were in a different places in different provinces and discovered new wonders and pleasures.
		We traveled throughout the country of India, got to know the local culture, the customs, the different foods,
		the special tables and more.The experience was fascinating and very rewarding.</p> <br>
		
		<p>We started our experience as a young couple traveling alone in many places and later in 2020 
			we returned to Goa in India to do a trip with our children. at that time our eldest child was 3 years old and the youngest was one year old.
			Traveling in India can sometimes be a challenging journey, even more so with children.  </p>
		<p>There is a big difference between a trip as a couple without children and a family trip.
		After the trip with the children we understood how much we enjoyed to be together.
		we realized how important it is for us and the children to spend quality time with the family and how valuable this type of experience is.
		It was an unforgettable experience that we will undoubtedly do again.</p> <br>
